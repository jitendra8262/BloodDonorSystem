1.1 BLOOD DONOR SELECTION
The primary responsibility of a blood transfusion service is to provide a safe,
sufficient and timely supply of blood and blood products. In fulfilling this
responsibility, the BTS should ensure that the act of blood donation is safe and
causes no harm to the donor (3,5,8). It should build and maintain a pool of safe,
voluntary non-remunerated blood donors and take all necessary steps to ensure
that the products derived from donated blood are efficacious for the recipient,
with a minimal risk of any infection that could be transmitted through transfusion.
All prospective blood donors should therefore be assessed for their suitability
to donate blood, on each occasion of donation. The purpose of blood donor
selection is to:
 Protect donor health and safety by collecting blood only from healthy
individuals
 Ensure patient safety by collecting blood only from donors whose donations,
when transfused, will be safe for the recipients
 Identify any factors that might make an individual unsuitable as a donor,
either temporarily or permanently
 Reduce the unnecessary deferral of safe and healthy donors
 Ensure the quality of blood products derived from whole blood and
apheresis donations
 Minimize the wastage of resources resulting from the collection of
unsuitable donations.
Information provided by 164 countries to the WHO Global Database on Blood
Safety indicates that, worldwide, more than 92 million blood donations are
collected annually. Of these, an estimated 1.6 million units are discarded due
to the presence of infectious markers for TTI, including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis
C and syphilis. In addition, at least 13 million prospective donors are deferred
from donating blood due to anaemia, existing medical conditions or the risk of
infections that could be transmitted through transfusion (9). The scale of these
discards and deferrals highlights the need for effective blood donor selection
to minimize the unnecessary deferral of suitable donors, and the donation of
blood by unsuitable donors that subsequently has to be discarded; this will
reduce the wastage of resources, including donor and staff time, consumables
and screening tests, and also avoid needless discomfort to donors.
Significant variations have been observed between countries in the extent to
which national donor selection criteria are defined, prospective donors are
assessed and the quality and effectiveness of the donor selection process are
monitored. In some countries, national systems of blood donor selection are
not well-developed and donor selection criteria are not clearly defined or applied
uniformly. This may result in blood being collected from donors who have not
been properly assessed for their suitability to donate; this may affect their health
and pose a higher risk of transmission of infections through transfusion.
In many countries, donor selection criteria are still based on tradition and
customary practice rather than on evidence (10,11) and criteria from one country
are often adopted in other countries without due consideration of the profiles
